      <h1><em>Greeting</em></h1>
         <p>Hello to whomever is reading this! Prior to diving into my hobbies and passions, I felt that there should be 
         an introduction in order. So, please read on to get to know me! 
         </p>
      <h1><em>Introduction</em></h1>
      <p>My name is Aleia Parker, and I am born and raised from Saint Louis, MO. My birthday is August 27 and 
         I'll be turning 27 this year. Ironic right? I have a lot of hobbies to choose from but the main two that I 
         will be focusing on is anime and video games. These two hobbies are the ones I resonate with the most, but 
         additional hobbies of mine aside from what this web page covers are playing the piano, learning foreign languages
         (like Japanese, Korean, Spanish), watching Netflix, listening to music and audiobooks, and learning new recipes! Without further ado, 
         let's dive into my main two hobbies! </p>

                  <h2>Anime</h2>
                  <p>I've been into anime since 2018 and absolutely been hooked every since. I love anime because it gives me
                  an escape and actually teaches you life lessons about friendship, family, and love! It also teaches you about 
                  core values and has its funny moments. Keep scrolling to see my favorite anime! </p>

            <h3><em>Demon Slayer</em></h3>
               <p>I love Demon Slayer mainly due to the main character named Tanjiro, he is unapologetically himself and has
               enrolled into the Demon Slayer corps to protect humans by slaying the demons that try to go after humans. I love that
               despite the demons intent to devour humans, he still shows empathy and prays prior to slaying them. Usually before it's time to defeat a demon,
               it shows why the demon ended up becoming who or what it became. The pureness of Tanjiro's heart is easily one of the many 
               reasons why I love this anime, as well as the beautiful artwork.</p>

               <h3><em>Naruto</em></h3>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Naruto was one of the first animes that I've watched when first starting anime. This anime will always 
                  remain in my top favorite animes of all time. It's up there with the OG animes like One Piece, DBZ
                  (Dragon Ball Z), and Bleach therefore it's a very long anime. There are two different time periods that
                  Naruto takes place in, which is the Naruto where he was a kid growing up (which is 9 seasons long) and 
                  Naruto Shippuden, which is the one where he was a teenager growing into an adult. When you watch it from
                  the beginning it's like you're watching Naruto grow up, along with those that are around him like friends and 
                  those who he considers family. Over time, just like with most anime of this length, you begin to feel connected
                  to the characters and the story. This anime has gotten me through some tough times so it was always be nostalgic
                  to me. Fun fact is, I haven't finished Shippuden yet because I'm not ready for the anime to end. However, there 
                  is Boruto which takes place after Shippuden but I've heard bad views about it due to the different writing style.

            <h3><em>Baki</em></h3>
               <p>I started watching Baki this year, what inspired me to watch Baki was this movie coming out on 
               Netflix called "Baki Hanma vs Kengan Ashura", which I was already biased about because I watched Kengan 
               Ashura already sometime last year, but I wanted to have an unbiased view and wanted to know the strength of the other characters
               in Baki to make a more accurate assumption on who might win a fight against one another, you know? So I started watching Baki n                and now I love it more than Kengan Ashura! I love Baki because his character is well rounded and emotionally 
               intelligent with a great sense of humor and he cares and protects those he loves unapologetically, especially his girlfriend 
               Yozue. Most fighting animes focus solely on fighing but in Baki there's more substance in regards to family 
               and the connection each character has to one another, not to say Kengan Ashura isn't like that but it's more 
               fighting focused. I haven't finished Baki yet but I'm at the end of season 2 and about to start season 3.</p>

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>I've been playing video games ever since I was a child, from the pink Nintendo DS to the Playstation 1
               through Playstation 5, I've even played Xbox for a short period of time, but I will always be a Playstation
               girl. Below are a list of some of my favorite video games!
            </p>
            <h3><em>Persona</em></h3>
            <p>I love Persona because it reminds me of real life. You get to go to school, study for your classes, 
               maintain friendships, and correct the hearts of those who are doing wrong in society and make them confess to their 
               crimes to help the victims lives they're affecting. So it's like you're a student by day but a secret superhero at
               night. This is my go to game if I want to just relax and clear my mind.
            </p>

            <h3><em>Rise of the Ronin</em></h3>
            <p>I love Rise of Ronin because I'm really into Japanese culture and you really get immersed into it through the gameplay.
               You learn about Japanese history between Japan and the US, you get to create your own character (male or female) so it feels more personalized 
               and you get to choose how history unfolds by making choices you feel is best. Each choice will have an impact on history so it makes me feel
               like I'm truly making a difference. I also get to look back on the choices I've made and how it inspired certain events throughout
               history.
            </p>

            <h3><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></h3>
            <p>I love this game because it consists of a strong female lead and how she's on a self journey to find 
               out who she is and where she comes from. The journey shows how courages and head strong she is, and usually
               in games like this there's an obvious option to explore love interests between characters but not in this game
               which really makes it even better because it leaves more focus on the pursuit of her finding out who she really is.
               It's definitely a game that will pull on your heart strings.
            </p>
